                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  OneTimeEmail was born from a simple yet profound realization: in the digital age, our email addresses have become extensions of our personal identities. Every online interaction requires this crucial piece of personal information, yet the consequences of sharing it freely are often overlooked or underestimated.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Our founders recognized that the current email ecosystem creates an imbalance of power. Users are forced to choose between convenience and privacy, often sacrificing their personal data for access to digital services. This fundamental flaw in the system inspired us to create a solution that empowers users to maintain control over their digital footprint.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  What started as a simple idea has evolved into a comprehensive platform dedicated to protecting digital privacy. We believe that privacy should be the default, not an optional add-on, and that users should never have to compromise their personal information for basic online functionality.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  At OneTimeEmail, our mission is to democratize digital privacy by providing accessible, secure, and user-friendly temporary email solutions. We are committed to creating a digital environment where users can interact with online services without fear of data exploitation, spam accumulation, or privacy invasion.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We envision a world where privacy is not a privilege reserved for the technically savvy, but a fundamental right available to everyone. Our service bridges the gap between technological complexity and user-friendly accessibility, making advanced privacy protection available to users of all technical backgrounds.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Our privacy philosophy is built on three fundamental principles: transparency, minimalism, and user control. We believe that privacy protection should be transparent - users should understand exactly how their data is handled and why. Our minimalist approach means we collect only what is absolutely necessary for service functionality, and our commitment to user control ensures that individuals maintain complete authority over their digital interactions.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  This philosophy extends beyond our service offerings to influence every aspect of our operations. From development practices to customer communication, privacy-first thinking guides our decision-making process and ensures that user protection remains our highest priority.

                  In an era where digital communication has become ubiquitous, the traditional email system has revealed significant vulnerabilities. Personal email addresses have become valuable commodities, traded between companies and exploited by malicious actors. This has created an environment where users must constantly weigh the benefits of online services against the risks to their personal privacy.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The current email ecosystem suffers from several systemic issues: permanent data retention, widespread tracking, spam proliferation, and insufficient user control. These problems have created a privacy crisis that affects millions of internet users worldwide, leading to increased instances of identity theft, data breaches, and unwanted marketing intrusion.
