              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Last year, Sarah, a marketing director at a tech startup, made what seemed like a harmless decision. She used her work email to sign up for a "free" marketing tool trial. Within three months, that single email address had been sold to 47 different marketing companies.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The result? Her company's email domain got flagged as spam due to the volume of promotional emails being sent to their servers. Their legitimate customer communications started landing in spam folders. Sales dropped 23% before they figured out what happened.
              </p>

                Why do smart people make these email privacy mistakes? After interviewing dozens of people who've experienced email-related privacy breaches, three psychological patterns emerged:

                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                    "I knew I should use different emails, but it was just easier to use the same one everywhere. Until it wasn't." - Sarah K., Marketing Director
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                    Our brains are wired to choose immediate convenience over future security. The solution isn't willpower - it's making the secure choice as convenient as the risky one.

                    "I thought, 'I'm not doing anything wrong, so why worry about privacy?' Then my shopping habits were used against me in a loan application." - James T., Accountant

                  <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                    Privacy isn't about hiding wrongdoing - it's about maintaining control over your personal information and preventing it from being used against you.
